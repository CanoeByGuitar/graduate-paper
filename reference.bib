abstract = {As a kind of meshless method, material point method (MPM) applies an Eulerian background grid served as a finite element mesh in each time step, and therefore its accuracy and efficiency are mainly dependent on the cell size setting of background grid. However, the conventional MPM commonly uses a regular background grid with uniform cells, which is not apposite for localized extreme deformation problems from the view point of computation efficiency, where, in fact, a local refined background grid is preferable. Hence, a mesh-grading material point method (MGMPM) is proposed here for such problems to supply MPM with the ability for local refinement simulation. The edge displacement continuity associated with mesh grading is embedded in the nodal shape functions. Besides, the truss element is incorporated into MGMPM to model the steel reinforcement bars in reinforced concrete impacting problems, based on our previous work. Furthermore, the proposed method is parallelized using OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) to take advantage of PC power with multi-core and hyper threading technologies for large scale engineering problems, where both loop-level parallelism and code-block parallelism are used. Several numerical examples including stress wave propagation, Taylor bar impact, and penetration problems, are studied, which show that the efficiency of MGMPM is much higher than that of conventional MPM, and with lower memory requirement.}

abstract = {Harnessing the power of modern multi-GPU architectures, we present a massively parallel simulation system based on the Material Point Method (MPM) for simulating physical behaviors of materials undergoing complex topological changes, self-collision, and large deformations. Our system makes three critical contributions. First, we introduce a new particle data structure that promotes coalesced memory access patterns on the GPU and eliminates the need for complex atomic operations on the memory hierarchy when writing particle data to the grid. Second, we propose a kernel fusion approach using a new Grid-to-Particles-to-Grid (G2P2G) scheme, which efficiently reduces GPU kernel launches, improves latency, and significantly reduces the amount of global memory needed to store particle data. Finally, we introduce optimized algorithmic designs that allow for efficient sparse grids in a shared memory context, enabling us to best utilize modern multi-GPU computational platforms for hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian computational patterns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with extensive benchmarks, evaluations, and dynamic simulations with elastoplasticity, granular media, and fluid dynamics. In comparisons against an open-source and heavily optimized CPU-based MPM codebase [Fang et al. 2019] on an elastic sphere colliding scene with particle counts ranging from 5 to 40 million, our GPU MPM achieves over 100x per-time-step speedup on a workstation with an Intel 8086K CPU and a single Quadro P6000 GPU, exposing exciting possibilities for future MPM simulations in computer graphics and computational science. Moreover, compared to the state-of-the-art GPU MPM method [Hu et al. 2019a], we not only achieve 2x acceleration on a single GPU but our kernel fusion strategy and Array-of-Structs-of-Array (AoSoA) data structure design also generalizes to multi-GPU systems. Our multi-GPU MPM exhibits near-perfect weak and strong scaling with 4 GPUs, enabling performant and large-scale simulations on a 10243 grid with close to 100 million particles with less than 4 minutes per frame on a single 4-GPU workstation and 134 million particles with less than 1 minute per frame on an 8-GPU workstation.},

abstract = {The Material Point Method (MPM) has been shown to facilitate effective simulations of physically complex and topologically challenging materials, with a wealth of emerging applications in computational engineering and visual computing. Borne out of the extreme importance of regularity, MPM is given attractive parallelization opportunities on high-performance modern multiprocessors. Parallelization of MPM that fully leverages computing resources presents challenges that require exploring an extensive design-space for favorable data structures and algorithms. Unlike the conceptually simple CPU parallelization, where the coarse partition of tasks can be easily applied, it takes greater effort to reach the GPU hardware saturation due to its many-core SIMT architecture. In this paper we introduce methods for addressing the computational challenges of MPM and extending the capabilities of general simulation systems based on MPM, particularly concentrating on GPU optimization. In addition to our open-source high-performance framework, we also conduct performance analyses and benchmark experiments to compare against alternative design choices which may superficially appear to be reasonable, but can suffer from suboptimal performance in practice. Our explicit and fully implicit GPU MPM solvers are further equipped with a Moving Least Squares MPM heat solver and a novel sand constitutive model to enable fast simulations of a wide range of materials. We demonstrate that more than an order of magnitude performance improvement can be achieved with our GPU solvers. Practical high-resolution examples with up to ten million particles run in less than one minute per frame.},

abstract = {We introduce a new method for fluid simulation on high-resolution adaptive grids which rivals the throughput and parallelism potential of methods based on uniform grids. Our enabling contribution is SPGrid, a new data structure for compact storage and efficient stream processing of sparsely populated uniform Cartesian grids. SPGrid leverages the extensive hardware acceleration mechanisms inherent in the x86 Virtual Memory Management system to deliver sequential and stencil access bandwidth comparable to dense uniform grids. Second, we eschew tree-based adaptive data structures in favor of storing simulation variables in a pyramid of sparsely populated uniform grids, thus avoiding the cost of indirect memory access associated with pointer-based representations. We show how the costliest algorithmic kernels of fluid simulation can be implemented as a composition of two kernel types: (a) stencil operations on a single sparse uniform grid, and (b) structured data transfers between adjacent levels of resolution, even when modeling non-graded octrees. Finally, we demonstrate an adaptive multigrid-preconditioned Conjugate Gradient solver that achieves resolution-independent convergence rates while admitting a lightweight implementation with a modest memory footprint. Our method is complemented by a new interpolation scheme that reduces dissipative effects and simplifies dynamic grid adaptation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in end-to-end simulations of smoke flow.},

abstract = {We have developed a novel hierarchical data structure for the efficient representation of sparse, time-varying volumetric data discretized on a 3D grid. Our “VDB”, so named because it is a Volumetric, Dynamic grid that shares several characteristics with B+trees, exploits spatial coherency of time-varying data to separately and compactly encode data values and grid topology. VDB models a virtually infinite 3D index space that allows for cache-coherent and fast data access into sparse volumes of high resolution. It imposes no topology restrictions on the sparsity of the volumetric data, and it supports fast (average O(1)) random access patterns when the data are inserted, retrieved, or deleted. This is in contrast to most existing sparse volumetric data structures, which assume either static or manifold topology and require specific data access patterns to compensate for slow random access. Since the VDB data structure is fundamentally hierarchical, it also facilitates adaptive grid sampling, and the inherent acceleration structure leads to fast algorithms that are well-suited for simulations. As such, VDB has proven useful for several applications that call for large, sparse, animated volumes, for example, level set dynamics and cloud modeling. In this article, we showcase some of these algorithms and compare VDB with existing, state-of-the-art data structures.},

abstract = {We present a multi-species model for the simulation of gravity driven landslides and debris flows with porous sand and water interactions. We use continuum mixture theory to describe individual phases where each species individually obeys conservation of mass and momentum and they are coupled through a momentum exchange term. Water is modeled as a weakly compressible fluid and sand is modeled with an elastoplastic law whose cohesion varies with water saturation. We use a two-grid Material Point Method to discretize the governing equations. The momentum exchange term in the mixture theory is relatively stiff and we use semi-implicit time stepping to avoid associated small time steps. Our semi-implicit treatment is explicit in plasticity and preserves symmetry of force linearizations. We develop a novel regularization of the elastic part of the sand constitutive model that better mimics plasticity during the implicit solve to prevent numerical cohesion artifacts that would otherwise have occurred. Lastly, we develop an improved return mapping for sand plasticity that prevents volume gain artifacts in the traditional Drucker-Prager model.},

We demonstrate that the Drucker-Prager plastic flow model combined with a Hencky-strain-based hyperelasticity accurately recreates a wide range of visual sand phenomena with moderate computational expense. We use the Material Point Method (MPM) to discretize the governing equations for its natural treatment of contact, topological change and history dependent constitutive relations. The Drucker-Prager model naturally represents the frictional relation between shear and normal stresses through a yield stress criterion. We develop a stress projection algorithm used for enforcing this condition with a non-associative flow rule that works naturally with both implicit and explicit time integration. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on examples undergoing large deformation, collisions and topological changes necessary for producing modern visual effects.},

abstract = {Porous materials are common in daily life. They include granular material (e.g. sand) that behaves like liquid flow when mixed with fluid and foam material (e.g. sponge) that deforms like solid when interacting with liquid. The underlying physics is further complicated when multiple fluids interact with porous materials involving coupling between rigid and fluid bodies, which may follow different physics models such as the Darcy's law and the multiple-fluid Navier-Stokes equations. We propose a unified particle framework for the simulation of multiple-fluid flows and porous materials. A novel virtual phase concept is introduced to avoid explicit particle state tracking and runtime particle deletion/insertion. Our unified model is flexible and stable to cope with multiple fluid interacting with porous materials, and it can ensure consistent mass and momentum transport over the whole simulation space.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the rapid deployment of numerous physics-based modeling and simulation algorithms and techniques for fluids, solids, and their delicate coupling in computer animation. However, it still remains a challenging problem to model the complex elastic-viscoplastic behaviors during fluid–solid phase transitions and facilitate their seamless interactions inside the same framework. In this article, we propose a practical method capable of simulating granular flows, viscoplastic liquids, elastic-plastic solids, rigid bodies, and interacting with each other, to support novel phenomena all heavily involving realistic phase transitions, including dissolution, melting, cooling, expansion, shrinking, and so on. At the physics level, we propose to combine and morph von Mises with Drucker–Prager and Cam–Clay yield models to establish a unified phase-field-driven EVP model, capable of describing the behaviors of granular, elastic, plastic, viscous materials, liquid, non-Newtonian fluids, and their smooth evolution. At the numerical level, we derive the discretization form of Cahn–Hilliard and Allen–Cahn equations with the material point method to effectively track the phase-field evolution, so as to avoid explicit handling of the boundary conditions at the interface. At the application level, we design a novel heuristic strategy to control specialized behaviors via user-defined schemes, including chemical potential, density curve, and so on. We exhibit a set of numerous experimental results consisting of challenging scenarios to validate the effectiveness and versatility of the new unified approach. This flexible and highly stable framework, founded upon the unified treatment and seamless coupling among various phases, and effective numerical discretization, has its unique advantage in animation creation toward novel phenomena heavily involving phase transitions with artistic creativity and guidance.},
